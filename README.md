Bricks
======
My first project to make a clone of Bejeweled.
You start with a screen full of randomized 6-colored bricks.
You get points by selecting and removing bricks of the same color. 
You can't remove single bricks.
More points are awarded for big chunks of bricks that are removed by a single selection.
If only a single brick is left or all are removed, you finish the game.
Bricks are affected by gravity so if you make a hole they fall down.
There's gonna be three menu options: "New Game" "High Scores" and "Quit"
"High Scores" will be kept in a binary file called high.bri

If I manage to finish the procjet, I will think about some additions to game like:

- anti gravity blocks

- unselectable bricks

- bonuses for destroying shaped bricks

- single bricks destroying using bonuses

- color changing bonuses

- color swapping

- level editor

- predefined levels

and more...
