Bricks
======
Its my first project to make a clone of Bejeweled.
You start with screen full of randomized 6-colored bricks.
You get points by selecting and removing same color bricks. 
You cant remove single bricks.
More points are awarded for big chunks of bricks removed by single selection.
If only single bricks left or all are removed you finish game.
Gravity affects bricks so if you make a hole they will fall down.
Theres gonna be three menu options "New Game" "High Scores" and "Quit"
"High Scores" will be kept in binary file called high.bri

If i manage to finish it i will think about some additions to game like:

- anti gravity blocks

- unselectable bricks

- bonuses for destroying shaped bricks

- single bricks destroying using bonuses

- color changing bonuses

- color swapping

- level editor

- predefined levels

and more...
